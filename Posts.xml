Physics tells us that pressured water flow will take the path of least resistance. By this logic, the tamp functions by making the coffee bed smooth, even, and robust enough to be hit with 9 bars of pressure and extract evenly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Barista Health&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: In no way am I a qualified physician.

Collectively, these compounds that are found in coffee grounds are referred to as “coffee solubles” and significantly contribute to coffee flavor [2]. Brewing is the process of extracting these components from the grounds, so coffee beverages are technically a solution of coffee solubles and water. Given that coffee grounds are used in both of our brewing methods, the principle variables are temperature and time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Temperature affects the solubility and volatility of the coffee solubles. Relative to brewing, solubility describes the ability of the solubles to dissolve out of the grounds and into the water; volatility refers to their ability to evaporate into the air. Coffee solubles dissolve best at an optimal temperature of 195-205°F [3]. With more coffee solubles extracted, hot brew coffees are described as more full-bodied and flavorful when compared to cold brew. Moreover, due to increased volatility with higher temperatures, the aromatics are more readily released from coffee, giving rise to that beloved scent of freshly-brewed coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;On the downside, oxidation and degradation also occur more rapidly at higher temperatures. The oils in coffee solubles can oxidize more quickly at elevated temperatures, causing coffee to taste sour. Acids also degrade, the most notable of which is chlorogenic acid into quinic and caffeic acid, causing coffee to taste bitter [2].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Where cold brew lacks in temperature, it makes up for in time. Coffee solubles have markedly decreased solubility in room temperature water. Increasing the brew time from a few minutes to many hours aims to maximize extraction of the solubles from the grounds. Even over twenty-four hours, not all the coffee solubles will have dissolved; this is why the amount of coffee grounds is doubled, in an effort to make up for the lower extraction rate. In comparison with hot brew, cold brew is sometimes described as tasting “dead” or “flat” due to the lower yield of coffee solubles [3]. Further, decreased volatility prevents aromatics from escaping from coffee as easily, so cold brew is much less perfumed than its hot brew counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Oxidation and degradation will still occur in cold brew methods, but this happens much more slowly; bitterness and acidity are just about absent in cold brew coffee, especially if it is kept cold. Though, cold brew doesn’t merely taste like hot brew without the bitterness. Fans of the cold brew method have emphasized that cold brews contain a completely different flavor profile that can’t be found with hot brews. Going back to the idea of solubility, not all flavor compounds of coffee solubles are equally soluble. A good majority of the coffee solubles are still able to leach out of the grounds, even in colder water. The compounds that don’t dissolve are the ones often attributed to unfavorable flavors [4]: these stay in the grounds that are subsequently tossed away. Consequently, cold brews take on a much sweeter, floral profile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;To note, brew time does not determine caffeine content, nor does bitterness indicate coffee strength. Caffeine is extracted early in the brewing process, so extending brew time, by either method, would only result in over-extracted coffee [1]. Coffee “strength” is defined as the amount of dissolved coffee solubles per unit of coffee volume [1]. On that train of thought, cold brew certainly produces stronger coffee, given that the brewing process purposely concentrates the coffee solubles. Though, keep in mind that rarely anyone drinks cold brew coffee straight up; many enjoy this smooth drink diluted with milk or water. - &lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/&quot;&gt;https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24" LastActivityDate="2015-01-27T21:35:46.843" CommentCount="0" />

To ensure that the amount of dissolved solids and the overall extraction is correct (and minimally bitter), make sure to use the correct grind coarseness, water temperature, and brew time for your chosen method. Over extraction can be a major cause of bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Drip and pour-over brewing methods tend to have less bitterness than a french press or other immersion methods.

The metallic bitterness found in some coffee has been attributed to  dicaffeoylquinic acids. Trigonelline is perceived as bitter at concentrations of 0.25% and its degredation is proportional to roast level. Roasting Trigonelline produces a byproduct called pyridines and helps create the roasty aroma found in some coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chlorogenic acid is also found in coffee, higher concentrations in Robusta than Arabica, and that contributes to the bitterness as well. Additionally, Quinic acid is a product formed from the degradation of Chlorogenic acid and is present in coffee at twenty times its taste threshold, contributing to the bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furfuryl alcohol is also known to increase the bitterness of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeeresearch.org/science/bittermain.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.coffeeresearch.org/science/bittermain.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thekitchn.com/coffee-basics-the-difference-b-41949&quot;&gt;http://www.thekitchn.com/coffee-basics-the-difference-b-41949&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="38" LastEditorUserId="38" LastEditDate="2015-01-27T22:37:40.693" LastActivityDate="2015-01-27T22:37:40.693" CommentCount="0" />

While soft drinks which do not use caffeine as an ingredient are sometimes described as &quot;decaffeinated&quot;, they are better termed &quot;uncaffeinated&quot; because decaffeinated implies that there was caffeine present at one point in time. Decaffeinated drinks contain typically 1–2% of the original caffeine content or sometimes as much as 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case of coffee, various methods can be used. The process is usually performed on unroasted (green) beans, and starts with steaming of the beans. They are then rinsed with a solvent that extracts the caffeine while leaving other constituents largely unaffected. The process is repeated from 8 to 12 times until the caffeine content meets the required standard (97% of caffeine removed according to the international standard, or 99.9% caffeine-free by mass as per the EU standard). Coffee contains over 400 components important to the taste and aroma of the drink, so it is difficult to remove the caffeine without affecting other components.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Want to know even more?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Advanced&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, then, let's talk about the two most common types of decaffeination:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Swiss Water process&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The use of water as the solvent to decaffeinate coffee was originally pioneered in Switzerland in 1933 and developed as a commercially viable method of decaffeination by Coffex S.A. in 1980. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This method is different in that it does not directly or indirectly add chemicals to extract the caffeine. Rather, it relies entirely on two concepts - solubility and osmosis - to decaffeinate coffee beans. The process begins by immersing a batch of green coffee beans in very hot water in order to dissolve and extract the caffeine. The water is then drawn off and passed through an activated charcoal filter. The porosity of this filter is sized to only capture larger caffeine molecules, while allowing smaller oil and flavor molecules to pass through it. However, this extraction process will also extract desirable oils and other solids from the beans, resulting in beans with no caffeine and no flavor in one tank, and caffeine-free but with flavor water in another tank. The Swiss Water process method attempts to overcome this difficulty by first discarding the flavorless caffeine-free beans, and then reusing the flavor rich water to remove the caffeine from a fresh batch of coffee beans. Water saturated in this way is referred to as green coffee extract or GCE. It is created using a separate batch of green coffee beans, which are immersed in water and then discarded. In a pre-loading tank water, cane sugar and formic acid are mixed and heated and used to preload carbon filter columns. The GCE is then filtered over the columns to extract caffeine from it. A fresh batch of green coffee beans is then immersed in the GCE to remove caffeine but retain other components. The other components can be retained because the water is already saturated with flavor ingredients, therefore, the flavors in this fresh bath cannot dissolve - only caffeine moves from the coffee beans to the water. This results in decaffeination without a massive loss of flavor. The process of filtering the GCE to remove caffeine and immersing the beans is repeated until the beans are 99.9% caffeine free by mass, meeting the required standard. This process takes 8 to 10 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; process&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;it is technically known as supercritical fluid extraction. This method is the most recent method developed by Kurt Zosel, a scientist of the Max Plank Institute, and uses liquid CO2 in place of chemical solvents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts selectively on the caffeine, releasing the alkaloid and nothing else. Water soaked coffee beans are placed in an extraction vessel. The extractor is then sealed and liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is forced into the coffee at pressures of 1,000 pounds per square inch to extract the caffeine. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts as the solvent to dissolve and draw the caffeine from the coffee beans, leaving the larger-molecule flavor components behind. The caffeine laden CO2 is then transferred to another container called the absorption chamber where the pressure is released and the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; returns to its gaseous state and evaporates, leaving the caffeine behind. The caffeine is removed from the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; using charcoal filters and the caffeine free CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is pumped back into a pressurized container for reuse on another batch of beans. This process has the advantage that it avoids the use of potentially harmful substances. Because of its cost, this process is primarily used to decaffeinate large quantities of commercial-grade, less-exotic coffee found in grocery stores.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are like 3 more common processes but I believe 2 is enough, even for coffee enthusiasts like us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sourced from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not my opinion although I don't have decaf, but just something I picked up on the net:&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/j5w3t.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;I don&amp;#39;t know?!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="132" LastActivityDate="2015-01-28T13:34:08.870" CommentCount="0" />

Which may sound like a positive thing but caffeine carries a bitter taste which makes it an unpleasant drink. In fact the Robusta bean has 2.7% caffeine content, almost double the 1.5% of Arabica.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Arabica contains almost 60% more lipids and almost twice the concentration of sugar than Robusta. This factor also probably has a big impact on why we prefer the taste of Arabica.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From a price perspective, green beans of Robusta is about half the price of Arabica green beans on the commodity market.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Robusta is easier to tend to on the farm, has a higher yield and is less sensitive to insects - the extra caffeine is a chemical defense for the coffee seed as the quantity in the Robusta is toxic to bugs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of these factors help bring up the supply and lower the input costs for farmers to produce. With this more attractive price point, a lot of roasters back in the day would add Robusta to their blend in an attempt to reduce their costs and increase their profits. When coffee was initially sold in the 1900s the quality of coffee slowly and slowly deteriorated in an effort for companies to squeeze the most profit.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where you’ll find it: Nowadays, it’s not often you’ll find Robusta in a coffee blends or in coffee shop. If you’re drinking instant coffee? Well, that’s probably all Robusta… but you probably don’t care very much about taste. In your espresso blend? That’s a mixed bag. Literally. Oddly enough, Robusta is still widely used as part of espresso blends – specifically Italian style blends. &lt;em&gt;It is said to help improve&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;crema&lt;/strong&gt;. &#xA;One thing to note is despite the association with Arabica of being higher quality, and Robusta as being lower quality, it’s not always the case. Top notch specialty Robusta coffee will usually taste as good as or better than low end Arabica. However, high end Robusta isn’t widely used or available.

After roasting, they continue to be affected by environmental factors, their own natural instability, and interaction with other compounds. The most important of these processes are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dissipation into other media. Aromatics evaporate from the surface of the coffee into the atmosphere or are dissolved into solvents, where they often interact with other chemicals.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Non-enzymatic browning reactions. These involve carbohydrates, usually sugars, in carmelization and Maillard reactions. Carmelization occurs when a sugar gives up water and carbon dioxide, changing the structure of the sugar and its taste. The Maillard reaction is the result of an interaction between amino acids and carbohydrates in which an aromatically perceived substance is formed. When the Maillard reaction takes place at a high temperature (as in coffee roasting), the result is usually desirable roasted flavors and aromas, but when it takes place at a lower temperature, the result is flat, gluey, and cardboard-like flavors.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Oxidation. Oxidation is any reaction in which one or more electrons are moved from one chemical to another, producing two different compounds. In coffee, the most common process is that an oxygen molecule donates two electrons to a compound, forming a new (differently perceived) compound and bonding with hydrogen to form water.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The engine that drives all of these processes forward is thermal energy (heat).

Coffee is a crappy growth medium        and it should start out the next best thing to sterile, but, even covered, its going to start to get moldy.&#xA;  Obviously if you add dairy, then you're dealing with that dairy shelf-life, and that isn't very long at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, is your idea of going bad that it has a funny taste and is not as fresh as it once was, or is it that it actually tastes as though it is spoiled? Yes, coffee can go stale when it comes to taste, but it won’t actually be spoiled or dangerous to drink.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once your coffee is opened and introduced to oxygen, the shelf life timer begins to tick. Storing coffee in hot, humid, or sunlight areas will only make matters worse. The best way to keep your coffee fresh is to store it in a container that is air tight and will remain cool – but not in the refrigerator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do you typically buy your coffee ground for you? With a far greater surface area of coffee coming in contact with the oxygen, those grounds are going to stale much quicker than whole beans will. I highly recommend investing in a hand or electric grinder to experience the fresh taste and aroma of beans you’ve ground yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When coffee goes bad, it can become bitter and even rancid. Every bean will react differently to oxidation. If you start to notice your expertly roasted beans losing quality and general yumminess, it may be time to buy some fresh beans. Don’t know how to find amazing, fresh coffee? I wrote a guide on that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No matter what you do, you will not be able to get that fresh flavor back once it has left the bean. The most important thing to do is keep it locked up tight. However, if you are a true coffee lover, it may not sit around long enough to even think about going bad.

(The finest setting purports to be for Turkish coffee; the one I use is labeled 'espresso'.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I store the ground coffee in its can in the fridge for up to a week or a week and a half, depending on how long it takes me to drink it all. Today I'm using Trader Joe's &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00GK5R8IG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee&lt;/a&gt;, a delightful medium roast. (I just now learned that Serious Eats says &lt;a href=&quot;http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2014/01/worst-and-best-coffee-at-trader-joes-which-coffee-to-buy-tj.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;it's the best bet&lt;/a&gt; for Trader Joe's coffee.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The Water&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Melted snow from the Wasatch Mountains, filtered through whatever the county of Salt Lake does before it gets to my kitchen tap, and heated on the stove until just before the boil. There are tiny bubbles forming on the bottom of the kettle, but few of them are rising to the surface of the water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The Method&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty loosey-goosey about my brewing method, but the results are very consistent. This leads me to believe it's the equipment and the beans that are generating the great results, not anything I'm doing right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Set up the Aeropress for &lt;a href=&quot;http://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;inverted brewing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For one shot, use a generous scoop of ground coffee. Tap the assembly on the counter so the mound of coffee flattens out.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Slowly add your just-off-the-boil water. (I use a &lt;a href=&quot;http://districtbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Hario-Buono-Kettle.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;gooseneck kettle&lt;/a&gt; for easy, controlled pouring.) Rotate the Aeropress as you pour and do so until you can no longer see any dry grounds. (The chamber should be about 2/3 full when this is complete.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Stir slowly until you get that lovely uniform light brown color on the top of the mixture. I use the handle of the scoop for stirring.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Place the cap and filter on top of the assembly and wait 15-60 seconds. (My own brewing time varies wildly, depending on what distracts me during that time.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Press. With this fine grind and filter, you'll have to press a little harder than with the coarser grind. As you press you'll see foamy buildup gather on top of the grounds. You'll have to press extra hard at the end to squeeze all of that through, but it will drip down onto your shot at the end and form that delightful crema.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Edit:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I pay more attention each morning, I've noticed a couple more things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;My results vary significantly. I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; the contributing factors are the grind and how hard I press at the end.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I never use soap on my Aeropress equipment. I rinse it with tap water after each use, but never run it through the dishwasher. There may be buildup of coffee oils on the surfaces that helps (or hinders??) the foam making process.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Edit Redux:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the past few weeks I've been casually experimenting with my morning coffee and coming up with very inconclusive results.

This is closely followed by Altitude, green processing, and finally age of the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Differences by Region&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/5FChz.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sour &amp;amp; Acidity in coffee by Country&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on 10,000+ reviews, their seems to be little indication that you can determine the sourness or acidity of a coffee simply by where its grown! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, this lack of effect would disappear if we controlled for the altitude the coffee was grown at. Why? Because higher altitude plants are under more stress, forcing them to be more efficient - less leafs, less fruit, but each leaf has a higher respiratory rate, and each fruit is more potent! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Green Processing&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/UE9Xa.png&quot; alt=&quot;Distribution of Sour and Acidity by Green Processing&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This graph shows the difference in distribution of Sour &amp;amp; Acidity of washed coffee vs natural processed coffee. There is a very small difference in the skew and kurtosis, but it is statistically significant. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Washed Coffee brewed in a Chemex is on average more acidic than its natural washed counterpart. Why? This is most likely a cognitive, not chemical, effect. Because natural processed coffees ferment with bits of remnant fruit (the coffee cherry) they retain more sugars, some of which are preserved though the roasting process. The increase in fruity esters and sugar compounds masks the acidity - so even though there's about equal amounts, you taste it less in the natural processed coffees. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Age of the Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/Gn6eJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;Acid Degradation over Time&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you really want to avoid any acidity in coffee, you could drink it stale! But I don't suggest it - stale coffee lacks the caffeine and interesting flavors that make coffee wonderful. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This plot shows the rate of acid degradation in coffee from its first day since roast. The red line marks the 14th day from roast, when the average coffee goes stale. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Level of Roast&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/uajzo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Acidity VS Level of Roast&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This graph shows Sour and Acidity as a function of the level of roast; as roast increases, the average perception of acidity decreases (in coffee brewed in a chemex). The grey field shows the Standard Error within the fit. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should note, why is the error so high at the highest level of roast? These are coffees considered &quot;French&quot; or &quot;Italian&quot; or even &quot;Spanish&quot; roasts - you should consider these coffees burnt. The fruity and interesting acids such as malic, phosphoric, and citric have been destroyed by prolonged heat exposure in the roaster, &lt;strike&gt;and these coffees contain acrylamide, a carcinogen, which is not only bad for you, but also tastes terrible.&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The levels of acrylamide, a known carcinogen, peak early in the&#xA;  roasting process (at about 120 sec).  While acrylamide is still&#xA;  detectable in fully roasted and burnt coffees, it most likely don’t&#xA;  contribute to the unpleasant, burnt flavor in over-roasted coffee. &#xA;  Multiple studies suggest that the main chemicals that cause bad&#xA;  flavors in burnt coffee are heterocyclic aromatic amines and&#xA;  polyaromatic hydrocarbons.  These increase with roasting temperature&#xA;  and time and many compounds that fall into these categories are known&#xA;  or suspected carcinogens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Differences by Brewing Method&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An extension to this question, reviewing the differences in the level of acidity by brewing method has been answered here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/349/could-preparation-method-make-coffee-more-acidic/&quot;&gt;Could preparation method make coffee more acidic?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="100" LastEditorUserId="80" LastEditDate="2015-02-17T23:38:05.800" LastActivityDate="2015-02-17T23:38:05.800" CommentCount="3" />

For example, phenolic acids are mostly volatile; in hot coffee more are evaporating, thus you can more easily perceive them. The same is true for salicylic acid (a precursor to aspirin, which is acetylsalicylic acid). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, These acids are more readily soluble and easier to extract in hotter environments. In cold brew not only do you extract fewer molecules of the acid, but the ones that you do extract will trigger a less potent olfactory response.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Amino acids are a trickier issue. The chemical nature of amino acids greatly varies (like in polarity and size, functional groups, etc). Most free amino groups will be consumed during roasting via Maillard non-enzymatic browning. On average, the cold brew would extract more, simply because it would have more time to come out of the coffee (during the average 6-hour steep time). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This article is helpful:&lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="100" LastEditorUserId="80" LastEditDate="2015-02-17T23:37:22.793" LastActivityDate="2015-02-17T23:37:22.793" CommentCount="4" />

It's uniformly been stuff that's sat on a warmer for a long time (like, an hour or more) after brewing. Keeping coffee on heat after brewing &quot;cooks&quot; it down, just as keeping a soup or sauce on a simmer reduces it. However, it has the opposite effect on coffee than on sauces or soups; instead of making it richer, it destroys the more delicate flavor compounds and makes it taste burnt. Even reheating coffee in the microwave can make it taste more like an ashtray than coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="91" LastActivityDate="2015-01-29T19:44:04.803" CommentCount="0" />

Typically, the more expensive a coffee is, the higher quality it will be.  It's the age old phrase, 'You get what you pay for&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the less steps from it being picked to it being in your cup, the better.  Packaged, ground coffee has more steps (Packaging, grinding) before being brewed.  Whole bean coffee has less.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third, the longer it's been ground, the longer it has had to degrade.  You'll want to grind your whole-bean coffee as close to the time of brew as possible.  Oxygen will erode the flavor of the coffee over time.  Ground coffee has more surface area to be exposed to oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this addresses what you were asking properly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="18" LastActivityDate="2015-01-29T19:57:10.413" CommentCount="5" />

However, even the highest quality plants still need to be tended to and grown in the right environment.  So farming methods and location play a part.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a coffee cherry is grown and picked, it must be processed to get at the bean.  The fruit must be removed somehow and there are various ways to do this, any or all of which can influence the final flavor of the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those beans are then often sorted to create homogenous lots of coffee beans, some folks will claim that this sorting can influence final outcome as well.  Assuming the green beans are properly stored and shipped, they arrive finally at a roaster.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A roaster has potentially the most influence on the final outcome.  They may blend different lots of beans base on a want for a particular flavor profile (or to save money).  And they decide what roast either fits their business model or is best for the beans.  The very same batch of beans will produce drastically different cups of coffee (or espresso) based on the roast level.  Then there is storage of roasted beans.  Some companies grind their coffee before sale, which increases the rate (drastically) at which coffee stales.  Others sell the beans whole.  These will stale too and the rate depends on storage time and method.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally there is the actual method of brewing.  There is a myriad of methods, with some new ones even invented in the last decade.  Any of which can drastically alter the taste of the final product cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coffee is such a large industry that there are studies and information out there on each step of the process assuming all other variables the same.  One could literally write a book with multiple chapters covering each step of the process.  You still wouldn't be able to come up with any definitive answers because the final step is someone's taste buds and we all have different preferences.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="76" LastActivityDate="2015-01-29T20:07:08.770" CommentCount="0" />

Do this by subtracting the amount of water you added. You can find this amount by calculating exactly how much coffee you initially put into the coffee maker, minus the amount of coffee that was produced. This amount will be very small, but it will affect the mass of the final pulp. Measure out an equivalent amount of water (which is usually measured by volume rather than weight) and weight it on your scale, being sure to subtract the weight of the container from your final measurement. Subtract the weight of the water from the weight of the pulp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiply the dry measurement by the amount of caffeine in that type of coffee. If you made instant coffee and have 2 grams of dry instant, for instance, you will multiply this into 3,142 and divide by 100 for a final answer of 62.84 milligrams of caffeine in the coffee pulp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Voila!

Indeed, as far back as ten years ago we launched&#xA;  the espresso into orbit artistically with the photographs taken by&#xA;  Thierry Le Gouès and our Mission to Espresso calendar, which at the&#xA;  time may have looked like a work of science fiction but was actually&#xA;  just a vision of the future. In fact, today we are in a position to&#xA;  overcome the limits of weightlessness and enjoy a good espresso — the&#xA;  indisputable symbol of made in Italy products — on board the&#xA;  International Space Station. We are proud to have worked on this major&#xA;  project with Argotec, through the Lavazza Innovation Center, our&#xA;  division dedicated to research and product innovation: a scientific&#xA;  and engineering challenge which we hope will improve the living and&#xA;  nutrition quality of astronauts engaged on long missions.” &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“Our aerospace engineers — stated &lt;strong&gt;David Avino, Managing Director of Argotec&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;  — have designed a new-concept coffeemaker, which is safe for the&#xA;  astronauts and able to function in microgravity conditions, also&#xA;  thanks to Lavazza’s experience as a leader in capsule extraction 2&#xA;  systems. The functional project was already completed in June 2013:&#xA;  Argotec had been working on it for about one year. This is an ultra&#xA;  high-tech project which has led to innovative solutions, applicable&#xA;  with immediate returns on Earth as well. ISSpresso is a technological&#xA;  challenge that meets very stringent requirements, imposed by the&#xA;  Italian Space Agency, in terms of technical functionality and safety.&#xA;  In addition to the engineering aspect, Argotec is also taking care of&#xA;  the European astronauts’ training and nutrition. Food provides an&#xA;  important psychological support and being able to enjoy a good Italian&#xA;  espresso may be just the right way to finish off the menu designed&#xA;  especially for each astronaut, helping him or her to feel closer to&#xA;  home.” &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roberto Battiston, President of the Italian Space Agency added:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;  “ISSpresso is a perfect example of the way ISA's decision to make ISS&#xA;  national usage rights available to public-private partnership&#xA;  initiatives can result in a valorisation of public resources for&#xA;  technological, economic, and social objectives. The ISA will bring&#xA;  ISSpresso aboard the ISS, thanks to bilateral cooperation agreements&#xA;  with the NASA, as it shares with the project partners the objective of&#xA;  improving the quality of life of ISS astronauts, as well as the&#xA;  astronauts who will take part in future long interplanetary&#xA;  exploration missions. At the same time, we are also proud to&#xA;  contribute to the promotion of the image and spreading of the&#xA;  Made-in-Italy brand at international or better “space”, level.” &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A coffee break in space.&lt;/strong&gt; A prototype of the space coffee machine is&#xA;  currently being tested at Argotec’s laboratories and all the necessary&#xA;  functional and safety checks. In a subsequent phase, Finmeccanica –&#xA;  Selex ES will participate in the assessment activities aimed at&#xA;  launching ISSpresso into orbit with the Futura Mission crew, one of&#xA;  whom is the Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti. The ‘corner&#xA;  café’ on the ISS will be the hub for socialising on board the Station,&#xA;  a sort of social network in space, a venue for getting together,&#xA;  chatting and relaxing: an aspect that should not be ignored in&#xA;  missions that keep the astronauts away from home for many months in a&#xA;  very challenging environment. The innovative capsule system will also&#xA;  be able to prepare not only a regular espresso, but also a caffè lungo&#xA;  or hot beverages, such as tea, infusions and broth, so that food can&#xA;  also be rehydrated. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra-terrestrial technology.&lt;/strong&gt; Every tiniest detail&#xA;  of ISSpresso is designed to respond to a scientific and engineering&#xA;  challenge: in fact, the machine studies have enabled principles of&#xA;  physics and fluid dynamics to be tackled, such as the difficulty of&#xA;  handling liquids at high pressure and high temperature in a space&#xA;  environment. Just think that the plastic tube carrying the water&#xA;  inside a normal espresso machine has been replaced with a special&#xA;  steel tube &lt;strong&gt;designed to withstand pressure of more than 400 bar.&lt;/strong&gt; The&#xA;  machine is so complex that it weighs &lt;strong&gt;about 20 kilograms since there&#xA;  are back-ups of all the critical components for safety reasons in&#xA;  accordance with the specifications agreed upon with the Italian Space&#xA;  Agency.&lt;/strong&gt; ISSpresso represents a technologically high-value project&#xA;  which, besides increasing the variety of flavour in the astronauts’&#xA;  menu, will help improve our understanding of the principles of fluid&#xA;  dynamics and conditions in microgravity. Some of the solutions adopted&#xA;  have led to international patents, which will be useful both for&#xA;  future space missions and immediate terrestrial use...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It looks like its a heavy duty capsule system designed to withstand high pressure that not only makes coffee, but makes tea, broth, infusions and re-hydrates food. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/nov/24/space-station-coffee-maker-perfect-espresso&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Just found images on The Guardian:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/LA1Kv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And on &lt;a href=&quot;http://walyou.com/lavazza-argotec-isspresso/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://walyou.com/lavazza-argotec-isspresso/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/RC8Kj.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="31" LastEditorUserId="31" LastEditDate="2015-02-01T15:30:15.773" LastActivityDate="2015-02-01T15:30:15.773" CommentCount="6" />

Ground coffee has something between 27-30% of its mass being soluble, that is, stuff you can dissolve in water. If you kept boiling and boiling coffee grounds in water, eventually you’d get everything that the grounds have to give. Above 22-24%, however, and you’ve essentially reached too far or squeezed too hard, because unpleasant flavors will emerge. Below 18%, and you’re not getting enough out of the coffee, at worst, leaving the coffee with underdeveloped flavors or simply wasting coffee. So it sort of answers the question, “How much did you get from the grounds?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Strength: Pertains to how much of the final brew is coffee, and how much is water. SCAA Golden Cup says 1.15-1.35% brew strength is a desirable zone to the most number of people, though we espresso-lovers tend to like a bit more… something like 1.3-1.5% brew strength. Over 1.5, up to 2.0% or more, and you’re in the “heavy, thick” coffee zone. Simply put,“How much ended up in the cup?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ratio: Simply, grams per liter. It provides one of the major answers to the question that Yield and Strength might ask, that is, “How did you get there?” Perhaps the most easy-to-remember ratio is 60g/L, or 60 grams of coffee for every one liter of water. The fact that you can make a balanced, pleasing, delicious cup of coffee at 60 g/L should give any barista pause when they’re finding that they’re using 80 grams or more per liter when they’re making coffee. Is it “wrong” to make coffee at 90 g/L? No… but is the additional 50% of coffee yielding an additional 50% of coffee quality, compared to the barista down the street making superb coffee at 60 g/L?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the assistance of common men like me,&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rjtoe.gif&quot; alt=&quot;YEAHAHAHA!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, to clarify the actual number, if Arabica then 1 - 1.5 pounds per cycle and if Robusta 2 - 2.75 pounds.

I think it should be roughly ±20% accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;For any amount of &quot;good strength&quot; American-style coffee by any brew method, weigh the dry coffee in grams and multiply by 0.08, or 80mg of caffeine for each 10g of dry coffee.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Weakly extracted coffee might yield 0.6% of its weight in caffeine and very strongly extracted coffee might get close to 1% caffeine. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These numbers are for typical 100% Arabica or mostly Arabica blends. 100% Robusta beans (uncommon) could be about double the caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Explanation below:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Maximum caffeine content&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Typical premium roasted Arabica coffee beans like mine contain &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.academia.edu/6246212/Analytical_Methods_Measurement_of_caffeine_in_coffee_beans_with_UV_vis_spectrometer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;close to 1% caffeine by mass when measured by spectrophotometer (p 311)&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;though Robusta (less common and usually blended with Arabica in cheaper coffees) has&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robusta_coffee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;roughly twice that&#xA;much&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have a health concern like wanting to stay under the 300 mg guideline for pregnant women, you should be able to use this as the upper limit: &lt;strong&gt;each 10g of Arabica coffee contains about 100mg of caffeine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I use a 2 Tbsp scoop to measure beans before I grind them. One scoop of&#xA;beans weighs about &lt;strong&gt;12 grams&lt;/strong&gt; (yes I tared the scoop, but I did only weigh&#xA;once and am not comparing light or dark roasts which will vary in weight&#xA;and volume).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/NwqDW.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2Tbsp scoop of beans weighing 12g&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if I &lt;em&gt;eat&lt;/em&gt; that scoop of beans or grind them finely and drink them&#xA;with any amount of water I will be consuming the &lt;strong&gt;120 mg (1% of 12g) of caffeine&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;present in them. That should be an upper limit to this estimation&#xA;exercise. &lt;em&gt;The strongest &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; biggest/weakest cup of coffee I can brew with&#xA;that scoop of beans will have &lt;strong&gt;no more than&lt;/strong&gt; 120mg caffeine&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;How strong is my cup?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Typical American-style brewing methods and water ratios result in &#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mountaincity.com/brewing-1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;1% (weak) to 1.65% (too strong) disolved coffee solids, with 1.25%&#xA;considered optimal&lt;/a&gt; whereas &#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeechemistry.com/brewing/brewing-fundamentals.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;a typical espresso will contain on average 1.8-2.2%&quot;&#xA;solids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So 1 fl oz of brewed coffee or espresso weighs almost the same as water&#xA;(29.57 g) and contains 1-2% coffee solids (so about 30-60mg, or 38mg for&#xA;optimal brewed coffee and 60mg for espresso). That would be the upper&#xA;limit if the coffee solids were pure caffeine, but they can't be. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand,&#xA;the caffeine is probably more soluble than the other parts of the bean,&#xA;so even though it's only 1% of the mass of the beans it's probably more than 1% of the dissolved solids. That's the hard part. &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeechemistry.com/caffeine/caffeine-content-in-espresso-vs-drip-coffee1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Coffeechemistry.com says brewed coffee ends up with 8-15 mg caffeine per&#xA;oz and espresso 30-50 mg caffeine per oz&lt;/a&gt;. That's&#xA;a pretty huge range. But it means caffeine is a lot of what gets dissolved—25-50% of the solids in an ounce of brewed coffee or 50-83% of the solids in an ounce of espresso.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So: I typically make a nice strong 10 oz cup of coffee with my 12g of&#xA;beans containing a maximum of 120mg caffeine. So let's say that maximum 12 mg per oz is the &quot;too strong&quot; concentration above, with around 1.65% solids including almost 100% of the caffeine. If I brew&#xA;it &quot;too weak&quot; and it ends up 1% solids (60% of the &quot;too strong&quot; solids) I would guess&#xA;I'd proportionally get no more than 60% of the max caffeine, 7.2 mg per oz or 72 mg&#xA;for a 10oz cup. So that narrows the range to 72-120 mg of caffeine in my cup depending on the brew strength.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm guessing a good cup ends up somewhere in the middle, so I'm going to estimate my typical cup contains &lt;strong&gt;around 100 mg of caffeine from its 12g dry coffee,&lt;/strong&gt; or about 80% of the maximum caffeine present in the beans. From this I would suggest a decent&#xA;rule of thumb for &quot;optimal&quot; strength American-style brewed coffee is around &lt;strong&gt;0.8% of the mass of the beans used, or 80mg of caffeine for each 10g of dry coffee.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Bonus corollary/sanity check&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using the same method, a shot of espresso made with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeeforums.com/forum/coffee-drinks/2733-how-much-grounds-used-make-espresso.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;7g of ground&#xA;coffee&lt;/a&gt; maxes out around 70mg caffeine (77mg if 10% Robusta sometimes typical for Espresso blends), but the serving size and strength are more standardized than brewed coffee, so the &lt;strong&gt;64mg/shot&lt;/strong&gt; reported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/#q=caffeine%20in%20espresso&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the USDA and others&lt;/a&gt; also ends up being 80-90% of the caffeine present in the beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="86" LastEditorUserId="86" LastEditDate="2015-02-05T20:39:43.127" LastActivityDate="2015-02-05T20:39:43.127" CommentCount="0" />

At the start of every day, you can grind enough to get you through the day.

Grind finer and/or pour slower and you will get a stronger cup of coffee.  Grind courser and pour more quickly and you will get a weaker cup of coffee.  Pouring from the center sometime results in a raised edge around the rim, which isn't ideal when I am trying to fill the cone as full as possible, but in a true pour over, may be fine.  Pouring from the side seems to sometimes result in a small island of dry grounds floating in the middle of the cone.

I know that it sounds trivial, but the quality of water can affect how &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; coffee tastes. It can render your espresso tart, or turn your Folgers into mud pie soup. This should also result in less build up of 'gunk' in your machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, eliminate your filters as a cause of bad taste. To do this, heat some water to about 95 degrees Celsius, pour it through a few of the filters and into a container to cool. Wait for it to cool, smell and taste the water. Any after taste or odor? You got it from the filters, change your brand. While it's not &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; true, the more expensive the filter, the better the chance that it's not going to shed fibers or tastes into your brew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third, have your machine cleaned. Ask any diner who does it for them, and take it to wherever that is. Stuff can build up that a simple cleaning can't handle, the machine should be broken down and cleaned thoroughly, especially if you're getting that vegemite-like 'burnt'  taste to things. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, if Maxwell House is the coffee everyone can agree on, try putting a pinch of kosher salt in the basket with the grinds before you brew - it can &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; help to bring out latent flavors that might still be in the beans (provided that the coffee is still reasonably fresh), it won't make the coffee taste salty. Not much, 10 crystals or less, but try adding a pinch. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think pound for pound, you'll get the most out of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Having the machine professionally cleaned&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Having better water delivered, and using that to brew&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tossing a few crystals of kosher salt in with the grinds&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The machine you've got is a classic workhorse, and I'm sure it's got plenty of get-up-and-go left, but it does need to be maintained periodically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="101" LastActivityDate="2015-02-05T00:51:49.080" CommentCount="0" />

Additionally size may be used and beans can be sorted with screens (slightly more automated) to produce lots that appear more consistent in size.  While these things may affect appearance, they are not thought to affect taste (by most) and so all of these will likely be sold.  However, during these same processes, any truly &quot;bad&quot; beans (moldy, unformed, etc) will probably be removed and discarded.  If buyers see significant amounts of bad beans in a lot, it will be assumed that care was not taken in the processing of the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I roast at home and the only time I have ever &quot;sorted&quot; is if a bean or two from a previous batch was hidden in my drum and gets BBB'd (burnt beyond belief) in a second roasting process.  Depending on roasting process, there is always a range of time that the beans get to certain points, they don't all hit first crack or second crack at the same time.  If the beans are of sufficient quality and properly sorted after processing (at the source/origin) those ranges will be fairly narrow with not a lot of overlap.

Roasted coffee should be stored in opaque packaging, and any efforts to unify appearance would be nullified by proper storage.

I normally drink brewed coffee black, but I enjoy an occasional Americano. The only problem is that they're generally served around 400,000° and I can barely hold them and have to wait hours for them to cool down enough to drink. Sometimes I ask for ice or something to cool it quickly. If I just wait for it to cool, it tends to taste rather old and stale by the time I can handle it. Or maybe I just can't taste it because my tongue is crispy from preliminary attempts. But the crema and freshness is always long gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that must secretly be the real reason for a long black—by adding the espresso to the top of drinkable-temperature water, you still have a chance at the best flavors and aromas. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fivesenses.com.au/blog/2011/12/19/the-espresso-menu-explained&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the Australian coffee roasters Five Senses put it,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Regardless of the crema, the long black tastes best as it cools slightly from boiling to a drinkable temperature. Only then will you be able to perceive some of the finer nuances and sweetness of the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I would shoot to &lt;strong&gt;have the cup around the same temperature as good brewed coffee by the time it hits the drinker's lips&lt;/strong&gt;.

Basically the way it works is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Get a load of volunteers&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;By doing questionnaires, work out everything about them&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Track them over a long period of time&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See if there's a statistically significant link between combinations of behaviours (such as drinking coffee) and a particular outcome (diagnosis of Alzheimers) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All the standard stuff applies here: you are not testing for &lt;em&gt;causation&lt;/em&gt;, only for &lt;em&gt;correlation&lt;/em&gt;. For example, ~80% of Americans drink coffee, but in other cultures this number varies a lot. If the coffee drinkers in your study are predominantly American, and the non-coffee drinkers are predominantly not, you have a whole bunch of confounding factors. Designing your study to avoid this kind of situation is really hard, especially when you're relying on volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's also the issue of what exactly are you measuring? Someone might drink 3 cups a day now, but only has done for the past few years. Another person might drink 2 cups a day, but has done their whole life. Another person might drink 2 cups of decaff a day. Questionnaires are usually not sophisticated enough to capture this level of detail (partly because in your big expensive study you want to capture as much information about different behaviours as possible - not just coffee consumption).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember also that medical studies are &lt;em&gt;chronically&lt;/em&gt; badly reported in the mainstream press. Even in 'high-brow' publications, by the time the headline-writers get their hands on a study, the message can have changed &lt;em&gt;wildly&lt;/em&gt;. It's always worth trying to dig up the actual paper whenever new research is mentioned in the news. If no paper is linked, just ignore the headline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One tool against all of this uncertainty is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_analysis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;. This is where you look at every single study, weighted by how confident you are in the data (e.g. by weighting more to studies with more participants, and better questionnaires etc.).

Water is put into a bottom vessel; coffee grounds are placed on a perforated platform with attached cone, which is placed on/in the water vessel; a top holding tank with rubber gasket is screwed on top of the apparatus. The device is placed over a heat source, boiling the water;  the boiling water creates steam and pressure, which forces water through the grounds into the upper storage vessel.  The two chambers are separate, so the water is forced through the grounds once (upward). Somewhat similar to espresso, a moka pot develops some small amount of pressure to force (nearly boiling) water through grounds, though the pressure is much less than espresso (see also &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/298/262&quot;&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt;).

There is no separate storage vessel for the coffee once brewed; water (at first) or (partially-brewed) coffee is continuously boiled (passing up to the top of the chamber through a funnel/straw) and dripped over the grounds (which are instead at the top of the chamber, rather than in the middle as in the moka pot).  The brewed coffee ends up in the same place the plain water was at the beginning of the brew. Percolators often have a clever little clear cap in the middle of the top, so you can see when the brewing is occurring, and color of the brewed coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have both devices, and use them differently; e.g., a coarser grind for percolator.  I find the outcome of percolated coffee to be more like French press or perhaps drip; moka is more like Turkish coffee or espresso.

I (personally, with not-entirely-scientific -- yet! -- trials) find that &lt;strong&gt;soya milk brands that contain emulsifiers (or other additives) are less likely to curdle in coffee&lt;/strong&gt;.  My only guesses are that &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;these compounds (emulsifiers, thickeners, or stabilisers, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrageenan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;carrageenan&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthan_gum&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;xanthan gum&lt;/a&gt;) interfere with the coagulation, or&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;something else in the processing (perhaps, e.g., pasteurisation) has denatured the proteins or otherwise chemically changed the nutrients such that they are less likely (cf., UHT or ultra-pasteurised milk)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I generally prefer to avoid the additives, so this is an unfortunate conclusion for me personally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Freshness of the milk is also an issue; milk of all types will spoil and slowly start to curdle due to natural processes (fermentation, bacteria, other contamination). There's another question &lt;a href=&quot;http://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/45476/25286&quot;&gt;about storing soya milk in the freezer&lt;/a&gt;, where we reached similar conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the risk of making this an even longer answer, here are some other things to try:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;em&gt;cold coffee&lt;/em&gt; into soya milk.

Even if you had no air whatsoever in the flask, this process would still happen due to the dissolved oxygen in the water used to make the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The process of oxidation occurs much more readily at higher heats, hence the reason why cold brewed coffee does not go stale as quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the oxygen combines with the hydrogen, water is created. That hydrogen ion, when it was free, was adding to the acidity of the coffee. Once it is no longer free and connected to the oxygen, in the form of water, the pH of the coffee will rise slightly, making the coffee more bitter. This is can be perceived as 'staleness'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The compounds which are oxidized are the acids, aromatics, and oils.  All of these give your coffee it's great taste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Loss of heat&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the coffee cools, the molecules will vibrate more slowly. This leads to a drop in temperature and will occur in any container, no matter how good it is. Since you have described a situation with minimal heat loss, this process is negligible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The oxidation causes the coffee to become stale. This is a bean roasters worst nightmare. For the brewed coffee, it dismantles aromatics, acids, and oils - all key contributors to the coffee's flavor. It also raises the pH to make it more bitter and adds water to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So no, it won't taste the same at 5 pm as it would poured first thing in the morning. The taste of the coffee will change over the course of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answering your final question about duration of freshness:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How long will your coffee stay fresh in a perfect flask? That is a matter of opinion. Every coffee shop has a different standard for how long they let their brewed coffee sit. It can be 15 minutes to an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As soon as you roast a bean, it begins to stale. As soon as you grind coffee, it begins to stale. As soon as you brew coffee, it begins to stale. It's hard to qualify what you will consider to be 'fresh'. A purist will tell you that unless you consume the coffee immediately, your coffee will be stale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I said, it is a matter of opinion, and if you have the perfect flask, I would say you could wait about an hour before your coffee becomes stale. That's just me though. &lt;strong&gt;The sooner you drink it the better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What You Can Do&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure there is little to no air left in your flask.&lt;/strong&gt; You might also look into cold brewing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to read more about these chemical processes as they apply to coffee throughout the preparation process (roasting, grinding, brewing), then you can check out this resource.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blackbearcoffee.com/resources/81&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Black Bear Coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="225" LastEditorUserId="98" LastEditDate="2015-02-17T14:55:16.367" LastActivityDate="2015-02-17T14:55:16.367" CommentCount="2" />

The idea of butter (especially organic butter from pasture-raised animals) is to provide beneficial fatty acids (organic/pasture-raised butter purportedly having better Omega-3 content (see another &lt;a href=&quot;http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/q/6707&quot;&gt;skeptics.SE question about this&lt;/a&gt;) and vitamins -- both being purported for &quot;energy&quot; benefit. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's my take on the &quot;theory&quot; anyway; hopefully someone else has better links to some peer-reviewed study.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tried this concoction once, and found it (personally) to be not tasty enough to drink.

It is an oxymoron to have a zero calorie energy drink, but there are plenty of them on the market.

The diet requires you to cut out as many carbohydrates as possible out of your diet in order to get your body into a state of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis&quot;&gt;ketosis&lt;/a&gt;, where most of the energy in the body is produced by processing fat instead of carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When following the keto diet, you need to eat a lot of fat, minimum carbohydrates and a reasonable amount of protein.

It should get harder as the paste thickens along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Add this mixture to the boiling water (2.5 L in a pot on the stove over a fire to be exact), stir carefully and leave to boil for 2-3 min. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Put the paste in boiling water that is placed in a metal pot over a fire on a stove. Stir carefully then leave the mixture to boil for 2 to 3 minutes.

The mesh is probably stainless steel, perhaps with a gold-tinted coating, sandwiched between a plastic frame. They're alternatives to paper filters for filter/drip coffee. I find the outcome to be a little gritty/grainy; more like French press than a regular paper filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, if your filter is still performing well, I think &lt;strong&gt;you're probably fine with a shake-out, rinse, or occasional scrub&lt;/strong&gt;. However, &lt;strong&gt;any residue might impart off-tastes in your next brew&lt;/strong&gt; (hopefully what's left is just coffee remnants!). The leftover coffee stuck to your filter (that you didn't wash off) will oxidise, taste stale, etc. (See also &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/123/262&quot;&gt;this question about coffee going stale&lt;/a&gt; -- one answer says it only takes minutes!

So if you leave coffee in it, very wet, for a long time, you might be inviting flora and fauna that you don't want. You reported this in your question, but I'm surprised if it would happen very quickly. Clearly, when you have mould growing, you'll want to give it a good scrub. If you store your filter (grounds knocked out, even if not washed) in such a way that the filter can dry out more quickly (e.g., hanging, separate from the coffee maker, propped up to permit air flow, etc.) it seems that mould would have a harder time to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for getting clogged and occasionally needing a really thorough cleaning... I use a similar device for brewing tea, and it gets clogged sometimes. In fact, I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/51953/25286&quot;&gt;this question/answer on Cooking.SE&lt;/a&gt; recently about how it had become clogged after a decade of use; see that for more on how to get such a metal mesh really clean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A probably-obvious alternative is to use a paper filter.

Many places will have varying amounts of shade due to their altitudes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can't say that this type of shade gown plant is used in every country of different altitudes.. Some places require more shade (those with a high altitude) and others less shade (those with a low altitude). It depends on where you will plant your coffee plant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The further south (or, north) a farm is located from the Equator, the less need there is for shade cover to protect coffee plants from the rays of the sun: the strength of the sun's rays in, for example, Brazil (where the sun is at an angle) is far less than the direct overhead rays from Central America. Thus, while shade cover may prove advantageous in Central America it might actually lead to a fall in yield of crops in Brazil.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This directly copied from the website, word for word. The amount of shade needed will also depends on the sunlight's strength. Nearer the equator, it is stronger so more shade is required. Farther from the equator, it is weaker so less shade is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are maybe more, but these are some basic and critical disadvantages to shad grown planting.

Other than aesthetics and processing, there are no other differences in color.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;White : White paper filters are processed to get that clean, white shade. Chlorine bleaching or natural oxygen bleaching are common methods for whitening paper. Generally, better quality paper ones do not use chlorine bleach.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Avoid white coffee filters that have been whitened with cholrine bleaching. These types of filters have a lower quality than natural brown or white ones using natural oxygen methods. Performance may vary though. Look online like in Amazon for high quality paper filters and look at the reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Taste&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yep, some brown paper filters will add some extra taste to your coffee, sometimes not that good:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Melitta 'whites' are best. I use them, as they are oxygenated, not bleached. I don't care for any of the brown filters. I have used the Filtropa/Aroma (browns) and the Chemex and didn't care for them. Many brown filters introduce a wet cardboard taste into the brew. Hario is an exception but they are pricey.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brown paper filters add a wet cardboard taste to your coffee. That just makes your coffee less enjoyable. As said in the performance section, white filters are probably better (if only implied with natural oxygen methods to get the white). Hario is a brown paper filter that acts like a white paper filter, adding no extra, disgusting flavor into your coffee. It is rather expensive though. Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sweetmariascoffee.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&amp;amp;t=833&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; where all the information of this section came from.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Environmental Impacts&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well here is a paragraph about a study by Harvard about paper filters and such:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;According to Harvard Health Publications, paper filters are more effective at eliminating diterpenes than permanent or cloth filters. Paper filters are also easier to clean up -- you dispose of them after one use. Cloth and permanent filters must be cleaned after every use. Paper filters are not as environmentally friendly as the other types of filters, but since they’re made of natural fibers, they are biodegradable. To make paper filters more “green,” compost them along with your coffee grounds. For composting, natural brown filters are better than bleached white filters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paper filters aren't as eco-friendly as others but can are biodegradeable, unlike plastic which takes forever and metal, which probably takes even longer. Paper filters can even be used as compost with your coffee grounds. It will make good fertilizer with the rest of your compost. Using normal brown paper filters is preferred over bleached white filters. Production is nearly the same. A white paper filter is really a brown paper filter that is bleached or has added oxygen.

There's evidence that this was reasonably common into the 20th century, and evidence that some still do, for a variety of possible reasons! Though I've never seen this practice in person, the following is what I have aggregated from a bit of online searching.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://organon.jimhufford.com/2010/03/things-ive-always-wondered-about-cooling-saucer-edition/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; contains some good links about the topic.

Another anecdote, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.senate.gov/legislative/common/briefing/Senate_legislative_process.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;according to US government legend&lt;/a&gt;, George Washington (in a discussion with Thomas Jefferson) used the literal practice (cooling-off beverages in a saucer) as a metaphor for the cooling-off that occurs in the upper house of a bicameral legislature. Even if this exact exchange is embellished, it still suggests that the practice was common enough to be in the vernacular.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, pouring part of a hot beverage into a saucer would help cool it down faster. Many anecdotal sources have that as an assumed motivation; if you're in a hurry to start drinking your beverage (and are a bit careful about the pouring and the saucer-sipping) it's a practical way of doing so. Some other anecdotes suggest that it was fashionable or polite (maybe even fun?) -- perhaps like &lt;a href=&quot;http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/behaviourfood.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;eating peas off the back of one's fork&lt;/a&gt;.

If I&#xA;  were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee -- a&#xA;  type of coffee, a brew -- that made all of you happy, and then I asked&#xA;  you to rate that coffee, the average score in this room for coffee&#xA;  would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100. If, however, you allowed me&#xA;  to break you into coffee clusters, maybe three or four coffee&#xA;  clusters, and I could make coffee just for each of those individual&#xA;  clusters, your scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78. The difference&#xA;  between coffee at 60 and coffee at 78 is a difference between coffee&#xA;  that makes you wince, and coffee that makes you deliriously happy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="31" LastActivityDate="2015-02-23T18:06:11.733" CommentCount="0" />

Inside, outside, both? Soak? Hot or cold water?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can't really rinse &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the outside/inside of a paper filter. When you drop water on a piece of paper, it doesn't just stick onto the outside/inside, it soaks &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; sides of the paper filter. So, both sides. You probably want to soak your filter. This will get rid of any unnecessary chemicals and oils filtered from your filter. This will help make your coffee taste better. Your Serious Eats article is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; accurate. Well, soaking in hot water should do. Hot water will might peal off some paper plus a lot of harmful stuff. It is one-kill wonder for bacteria. The hot water will burn your harmful bacteria to death. So answering your first question: Both, Yes, Hot Water&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now let's answer your second question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How does it help?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, filters are needed to keep coffee clean by extracting and &quot;keeping&quot; the chemicals and oils. Then, what cleans the filters? This is where rinsing comes in. Let me show you an example. Your clothes keep you clean then you put them in the washing machine to get them clean. So the rinsing is just like the washing machine. Over time, the paper will absorb so many chemicals and oils, the performance goes down like a rock. Some trapped chemicals will join the coffee, allowing the coffee to be contaminated and less tasty. Rinsing will allow the hot water to kill the bacteria and let the filter transfer the chemicals to the water, where it will belong somewhere in a sewer. This will leave the filter very clean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And now I will answer your bonus question (Do you award extra rep for this ;-)?): &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What is being rinsed off?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, the chemicals and oils of course! As said in my previous answer, the water will take the chemicals and oils to the sewer with it. The pores in which the filter needs to cleanse are then empty and more useful. Paper sometimes peel off but will end in the sewer like the chemicals and the water. After one use, it is time for the trash. Of course, first-timers will have to learn that dust and other particles will also ruin the flavor and filter. That is really the &quot;dusty stuff&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Bonus Information About Your Experiments:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looks like they don't work. Sure, most coffee filters will add a papery taste to your coffee, depending on its quality. First, doing the first experiment doesn't really do anything. You need to add coffee, not water, to see a difference. An bad, uncleaned filter will add a papery taste plus some more unwanted taste into your coffee. A good, rinsed filter will add a tiny papery taste to your coffee. Adding something in which it has flavor will make the experiment more fun (a lot more coffee to taste) and effective. That also goes to your second experiment which almost is the first experiment itself for some reason... Anyways, chewing paper filters will &lt;strong&gt;absolutely&lt;/strong&gt; not do anything. All that does is leave you complaining and spitting for the next 12 hours. You might need a mint and some mouthwash after that for personal hygiene reasons :-).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps you!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="75" LastActivityDate="2015-02-24T00:36:52.153" CommentCount="1" />

There are several capsule-based espresso machines (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeereview.com/three-new-capsule-espresso-systems/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here's a review of Nespresso and three others&lt;/a&gt;). You place a small coffee-filled capsule (a.k.a. &quot;pod&quot;, made of aluminium, plastic, paper-wrapped, compressed puck, or other material) into the machine and press a button; seconds later it produces a coffee beverage. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My answers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;No.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In simple point of fact, &lt;strong&gt;espresso is not &lt;em&gt;traditionally&lt;/em&gt; made with a coffee-filled capsule&lt;/strong&gt;, so the beverage produced by capsule-based machines might be disqualified from being called espresso on that trivial issue alone. :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you subscribe to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espressoitaliano.org/en/The-Certified-Italian-Espresso.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;INEI&lt;/a&gt; being a benchmark of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espressoitaliano.org/files/File/istituzionale_inei_hq_en.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;espresso production standards (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;capsule systems may not meet INEI parameters... so if they don't, they're not an espresso on technicality alone&lt;/strong&gt;, with regard to &quot;Certified Italian Espresso&quot; at least. For example: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;quantity of coffee (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nespresso&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Nespresso might be light&lt;/a&gt;); &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;hot water should be used for espresso (some do use pressurized water; but it's not INEI espresso if the capsule system uses steam); &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some capsule systems (as noted by @EricPlaton below) &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; produce espresso-machine pressures, but there could be benefit (or problems) by &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/296/downsides-of-brewing-espresso-with-high-pressure&quot;&gt;using pressure that is too high&lt;/a&gt;, or on the other hand &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1563/262&quot;&gt;too low&lt;/a&gt; for extraction and crema. That said, &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress&quot;&gt;it seems that AeroPress can create crema&lt;/a&gt; at lower pressures, so perhaps the capsule systems produce a beverage more like AeroPress than espresso.[1]&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Maybe.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There have been several taste-tests of questionable &quot;legitimacy&quot; between capsule-based machines and traditional espresso machines. &lt;a href=&quot;http://aeon.co/magazine/culture/julian-baggini-coffee-artisans/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;One four-subject test&lt;/a&gt; gave &lt;em&gt;higher marks&lt;/em&gt; to the beverage produced from a capsule-based machine than a traditional espresso machine. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airtightinteractive.com/2008/09/starbucks-versus-nespresso-taste-test/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This one&lt;/a&gt; agrees. Another test disagreed, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/04/nespresso-coffee-overpriced-rubbish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;giving a capsule-based machine a scathing review&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe there are better reviews out there; these are mostly useful for anecdotes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you note, the resulting beverage from a capsule-based espresso system is similar to traditional espresso, crema and all. However, if you ordered an espresso from a proper cafe, and they gave you a beverage that was brewed using a capsule-based machine, would you feel cheated on principle? What if the beverage was indistinguishable from traditional espresso... or if you like the capsule-based system's result better?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;It doesn't matter.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is my personal conclusion. The result of the beverage produced by a capsule-based system is a decent replica of proper espresso. Capsule systems also are likely to produce a &lt;em&gt;consistent&lt;/em&gt; result. If you like the beverage that results (see above...), &lt;strong&gt;what difference does it make if it's &lt;em&gt;&quot;real&quot;&lt;/em&gt; espresso or not?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[1] Is AeroPress espresso?

Coconut Oil is much easier for me to find&#xA; 2. IMO, it tastes better than the butter&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tried the grass fed butter, and it was pretty good, but like I said. The coconut oil is much easier to find in stores and it actually tastes better. The butter does give the coffee a creamy texture that's good though, so I'd try both just to see which one you like better. I tried the MCT oil for a while and noticed that it can be a tad harsh on my digestive system, so I cut it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for results, in addition to having a significant boost in energy in the AM, I also noticed health benefits.

When I add a NO2 booster to the bulletproof coffee, I do feel a big difference, but that may not be for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I said all that to say, it does work...to an extent.

Paper filters win on performance, clean-up, and health. Flavour is personal preference.

In addition to the link in the original post, there are a few other online articles with comparisons, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[1] pretty good &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.air-n-water.com/coffee-filters-information.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;pro/con overview from air-n-water&lt;/a&gt; (obscure?);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[2] from &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldofcaffeine.com/2011/06/20/filter-drip-coffee-paper-vs-metal-filters/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;World of Caffeine&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[3] from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livestrong.com/article/281062-health-effects-of-gold-coffee-filters/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;LiveStrong&lt;/a&gt;, which advocates permanent filters (but has other statements with which I disagree);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[4] from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.melitta.com/en/Why-We-Filter-1662.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Melitta&lt;/a&gt;, but this may need a grain of salt, because they're in the business of making paper filters :)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From those and my personal experience, I extracted an overview and conclusions, below. Unfortunately I've written &lt;em&gt;a lot of text&lt;/em&gt; here, but there's a lot of facets. I've focused basically on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;paper versus metal mesh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, as the most common types; I maintain the conclusions are similar regardless of material.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Material.&lt;/strong&gt; There are several materials used for permanent filters, including the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;metal mesh (stainless steel or &quot;gold tone&quot;);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;nylon (or other plastic) mesh;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;perforated metal (thin metal sheet with holes);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;fabric (e.g., flannel, muslin, hemp).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of these surely have different properties, but properties that I focus on here are common to most.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One-time-use filters are predominantly paper, but could also be bamboo, natural fibre, or other material. See also &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1524/how-do-brown-and-white-paper-filters-compare&quot;&gt;this question for a comparison of brown versus white paper filters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance.&lt;/strong&gt; Paper filters are a finer filter; a permanent filter will permit some larger particles through to the cup. I find that a pot brewed with a permanent mesh filter will have a fine silt of coffee grounds at the bottom. For this same reason, some recommend to use a coarser grind for permanent filters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paper filters are also claimed to filter out some compounds (e.g., diterpenes such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/414/262&quot;&gt;cafestol, which may increase blood cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;). Coffee brewed by other (non-paper-filter) methods have a higher concentration of cafestol in the resulting beverage.  See article [2] for more health claims of paper filters. On the other hand [3] says that paper filters filter out some &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; things, such as antioxidants, but I haven't seen that claim anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flavour.&lt;/strong&gt; Link number [4] claims better taste on paper filter than permanent filter (I happen to agree).  Permanent filters should also allow more oils to pass through, which will certainly have an impact on flavour; this is probably personal preference. The grit that passes through will also have a bittering effect over time, but probably not significant if you're drinking right away. Some (e.g., [1]) say nylon/plastic mesh will retain off-flavours over time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost.&lt;/strong&gt; Varies greatly, but one can find permanent filters that are said to last for &quot;years&quot; for a few quid ($/€/£) up to 20-30 quid. Though dependent on usage and other factors, you'll have reasonable expectation of saving money over time by using a permanent filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean-up.&lt;/strong&gt; Clearly, the spent grounds from re-usable filters must be cleaned out; paper filters and their spent grounds can be pitched wholesale.  See another question about &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1518/do-i-need-to-clean-my-drip-brew-coffee-makers-filter-every-time&quot;&gt;how often and how much to clean a permanent filter&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, [3] claims that permanent filters are cleaner, but I don't agree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waste / environmental issues.&lt;/strong&gt; I couldn't find any data on how much energy is used to produce a paper filter versus a reusable filter, but many uses would certainly be necessary to break even! As far as waste volume though, you'll make up the difference with paper filters pretty quickly (but composting the paper instead alleviates this!). Cleaning permanent filters additionally requires water and detergent. Though, you may wish to &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1551/should-i-rinse-paper-coffee-filters-before-use&quot;&gt;rinse your paper filters&lt;/a&gt;, so water use is debatable. Ultimately, reusable filters will eventually wear out and need to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Conclusion.&lt;/strong&gt; For my money, personally, &lt;strong&gt;I prefer the paper filter:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Better flavour and texture (less bitter, less grit);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Convenience (easier to use and keep clean);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I compost the whole thing (paper filter, grounds and all), so the environmental impact is basically on the production end, which I'm okay with.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Marginal health concerns (cafestol/cholesterol; avoiding plastic whenever possible).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastActivityDate="2015-02-27T22:03:44.680" CommentCount="6" />

The most optimal way of &lt;strong&gt;tamping depends on every individual pull&lt;/strong&gt;: the beans (freshness and grind), your skill, machine, etc. at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the goal (and most important part, in my belief) is to &lt;strong&gt;pack the grounds uniformly.&lt;/strong&gt; Any non-uniformity in your puck will allow water to flow more through certain areas than others, giving you non-uniform extraction across your grounds (some over- and some under-extracted). For example, if your tamper isn't level, you'll end up with a &quot;slanted&quot; puck; if your grounds are packed &lt;em&gt;more loosely&lt;/em&gt; in some places than others... these can yield un-even pucks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, here's a few other common recommendations, some of which you mentioned in the question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Add the grounds uniformly and smooth before tamping. This gives you an even bed of grounds so you can tamp evenly.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;15 kg / 30 lb. of pressure. A bath scale could help until one gets this &quot;by feel&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use a heavy tamper. This helps you control all of the other parameters.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aim for sinking the tamp approximately as far as the bevel (a general rule).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Twisting is not necessary (some do at the end of the compression for &quot;polishing&quot;, but not necessary).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there's some controversial bits:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Knocking&quot; is something I totally don't understand. The idea is to tap the portafilter so as to somehow redistribute the grounds after tamping. I feel like it would just mess up a good puck, but some recommend it either to ensure uniformity of compression of the bottom and top of the puck, or to get grounds off of the side of the portafilter. More discussion at link [4].&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On the &quot;North, South, West, East&quot; topic: this illustrates tamping at four points around the portafilter. Since the tamp is &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; smaller than the portafilter, the theory is that tamping at points around the sides helps to prevent grounds from creeping up around the tamp (up the side of the portafilter). It seems to me that an appropriate sized tamp will alleviate most of this, but it seems like a reasonable recommendation. Some guides (e.g., below) recommend this, others don't. More at [1].&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few articles on different takes on tamping: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virtualcoffee.com/jun/perfect.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Virtual Coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ineedcoffee.com/espresso-tamping/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;I Need Coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeeresearch.org/espresso/tamping.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Coffee Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeegeek.com/opinions/coffeeatthemoment/10-07-2006&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CoffeeGeek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastEditorUserId="262" LastEditDate="2015-03-02T12:04:08.293" LastActivityDate="2015-03-02T12:04:08.293" CommentCount="0" />

So when you add more &lt;em&gt;fresh&lt;/em&gt; coffee to that cup, yes, you are essentially adding a minute amount of an external (and somewhat &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt;) flavor component to your brew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now whether that flavor component contributes to any any &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;perceptible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; change in flavor is highly debatable. Line up 100 coffee drinkers in a blind tasting, and I suspect there would be no statistically significant detection between &lt;em&gt;&quot;100% fresh&quot;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&quot;Christian's 0.083% dust-like coffee residuals.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your analogy to washing tea cans in a dishwasher is a bit off. Washing containers in a dishwasher is generally known to leave a perceptible taste of &lt;em&gt;soap&lt;/em&gt; on the container. Soap is completely foreign to the coffee-tasking experience so it is easily &lt;em&gt;tasted&lt;/em&gt; if it is present.

In either case, the cup is largely &lt;em&gt;stainless&lt;/em&gt;, so you are not likely building up any patina&amp;hellip; so you are essentially &quot;washing away&quot; the previous day's experiment each time you add a fresh cup of hot coffee.

Somehow this settles all the solids to the bottom of the pot and the coffee really tasted pretty good.

There are some &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower_Shock&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;bar soaps, like this one&lt;/a&gt;, that make the (largely unverified) claim that some of the caffeine is absorbed through your skin. Win-win?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;To keep this on-topic...&quot; As for using instant coffee or some other source of caffeine (e.g., pills) to be applied topically to your scalp, I can't find anything about that either. Concentrations cited in the study are &quot;0.001% and 0.005%.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_bean&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Coffee beans themselves&lt;/a&gt; have about 1-4% caffeine before roasting, so it's reasonable to expect that you could get to the concentration used in the study with a paste of instant coffee, but I don't know about the &quot;bioavailability&quot; of caffeine from topical application of instant coffee. Robusta beans are generally on the higher end of caffeine content and might be cheaper. Also, green beans will have a higher caffeine content than roasted, but I might be taking this a bit too far...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Standard &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackexchange.com/legal&quot;&gt;disclaimer&lt;/a&gt; -- this isn't medical advice, I'm not a doctor, seek actual legitimate advice if you have health concerns.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastEditorUserId="262" LastEditDate="2015-03-05T15:11:07.993" LastActivityDate="2015-03-05T15:11:07.993" CommentCount="0" />

In high enough quantities, sugar can overwhelm the perception of acidity (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cola&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cola&lt;/a&gt; has a pH ~2.5, but doesn't taste sour because the perception is overwhelmed by sugar/sweetness; see also &lt;a href=&quot;http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/17395/why-does-adding-sugar-to-sour-things-cause-them-not-to-be-sour&quot;&gt;this Seasoned Advice question on sugar reducing perception of sourness&lt;/a&gt;). I don't see how sugar could be &lt;em&gt;the cause&lt;/em&gt; of sourness (i.e., sugar is not acidic). &lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; That said, it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be the case that this is a temporal situation. Sugar &lt;em&gt;reduces&lt;/em&gt; the perception of sourness, but it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be the case this change is temporary: For example, if the sweetness (sugar) &lt;em&gt;dissipates more quickly&lt;/em&gt; than the sourness (acids), you might be left with &quot;more sourness than sweetness&quot; in the &lt;em&gt;aftertaste&lt;/em&gt; after some time. That is, you're left with &quot;un-maksked&quot; residual sourness which, though present all along, is more &lt;em&gt;perceptible&lt;/em&gt; after the sugar has dissipated. However, all of this is entirely speculation; I have no justification for this, and haven't found any supporting information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sweetness&lt;/em&gt; is perceived by the presence of &lt;em&gt;sugar&lt;/em&gt; (and/or other chemicals that happen to interact in similar ways with sweetness &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoreceptor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;perception&lt;/a&gt;).

You basically want to keep them reasonably cool and away from oxygen, sunlight, moisture and variations in temperature (which is why you don't keep them in the freezer except for long term storage). Generally in the pantry in an opaque, air-tight container. I one-way valve is recommended as recently roasted beans will emit CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. I bought a stack of &lt;a href=&quot;http://fivesenses.com.au/shop/associated/250g-empty-bags&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;250g resealable foil bags with the one-way valve&lt;/a&gt; from a local roaster and would use each bag a few times.

Generally you want to stir just enough to ensure all the grounds are thoroughly wetted, and that there are no air pockets. Stirring too much can over-extract which will increase the bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When pressing into the cup, do you only press until you hear the air hissing through, or do you keep going and compress the puck, squeezing out every bit of water you can?[1] The latter can over-extract and increase bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using paper filters vs. a metal disc filter. Also, some people believe pre-rinsing a paper filter makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously there are a lot of variables, and people can become amazingly pedantic. Fun if you don't mind a bit of experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With regards to water temperature, the general wisdom is that you want the slurry of coffee and water to brew at around 95&amp;deg;C, which is just a bit under boiling for optimal extraction. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tested.com/food/coffee/455840-how-important-coffee-brew-water-temperature/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This video&lt;/a&gt; gives some pretty good advice on this. Pre-heating the Aeropress would probably make the biggest difference here[2]. I usually just wait until the water in the kettle stops bubbling before pouring. Apparently it is possible to burn the grounds if you hit them with water that is boiling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other bugbear I have is with retention in coffee grinders. Retention is when grounds are left up in the works of the grinder, and often the grounds can come out very staticy and cling to everything and make a mess. This grosses me out as it means old grounds from previous grinding will be dropped in with the fresh grind. Weighing the beans before and after can show a variation of half a gram or more. Urk.[3] However I've found that sprinkling a couple of drops of water on the beans before grinding almost completely eliminates retention for me.[4]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[1] There's a term for over-squeezing the grounds that escapes me at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[2] Having lived a lot of my life in drought areas, using and then discarding the water to pre-heat my Aeropress or French press is something I find surprisingly hard to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[3] I did mention people can become amazingly pedantic, didn't I?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[4] Known as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.home-barista.com/grinders/ross-droplet-technique-eliminating-grinder-static-t24051.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ross Droplet Technique&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="271" LastActivityDate="2015-03-07T00:21:07.180" CommentCount="0" />
