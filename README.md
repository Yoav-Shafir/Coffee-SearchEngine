<h1>Elasticsearch Searchengine</h1>
<blockquote>
Elasticsearch & AngularJS search engine backed by Node.js.<br />
This is a simple AngularJS apllication which uses some of the powerful capabilities
of Elasticsearch such as: search, results highlighting, paging, sort, filtering, aggregation and auto suggestions.
<br />
<a href="https://ys-coffee-searchengine.herokuapp.com/">Demo</a>
<br />
The data used in the application can be found in 'Posts.xml' which is a public database dump taken from the
<a href="http://stackexchange.com/">StackExchange</a> site and is pushed to Elasticsearch in JSON format after running the load_posts.js script.
